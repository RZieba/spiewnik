Deesis.tex:68: Undefined control sequence
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

Deesis.tex:69: Missing $ inserted
I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

Deesis.tex:85: Missing $ inserted
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
